The Andorville™ Shares software is used to analyse share market data. Separate Access databases are used to store share prices, historical financials and calculated data. This software is being developed to test the performance of different share selection methods.

The ADVL_Database_Tools software is used to create the databases used by the Shares application. ADVL_Import is used to import the daily share price data and financial data into the databases. ADVL_Chart produces share price charts and plots of calculated data.
